# About

This project is my personal website portfolio and its infrastructure. It serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and experiences in the field of software development. 
The website is built with static HTML and Tailwind CSS as it is a landing page so you will be able to connect with me.

The infrastructure of the website is designed to be robust and scalable. It is hosted on a Digital Ocean's Droplet and uses Docker for the sake of the machine's configuration.

With this project and Docker I deployed an instance of [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/), [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/), [Nginx Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/) and [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/). 

In Nextcloud I can save and sync my files acrross devices acting as my literal personal cloud and with Gitea I have my 'own' private GIT server. Portainer is so I can manage the Docker Containers easily. 
Last but not least, the Nginx Proxy Manager is a way accomplish reverse proxying hosts with SSL termination with ease.

Why? Just because I like Docker and the idea of deploying applications, so I wanted to play around with it. 

Feel free to explore the code and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions.
